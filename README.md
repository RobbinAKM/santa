# Santa Letter Web Application
This web application allows children to send a message to Santa by entering their user ID and a message in a form. The application ensures that the child is registered and under 10 years old. It then forwards valid messages to Santa every 15 seconds.

### Prerequisites
This project requires Node.js to be installed on your machine.
- git clone https://github.com/RobbinAKM/santa.git
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js version **16.x** or later installed on your machine.

### Email Configuration
The application uses Ethereal email for sending notifications. Configure the email settings as follows:

- User: maximus.keeling3@ethereal.email
- Password: ```u1NsHUXRjKqytZrEFY```
- You can log in to Ethereal to view and manage your emails using the provided credentials at [Ethereal Email Login](https://ethereal.email/login)

### Installation
Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
To start both the frontend and backend servers, use the following command:
```
# Navigate to the santa/frontend directory
cd santa/frontend

# Navigate to the santa/backend directory
cd santa/backend

npm install
npm start
```
This will launch the application and open it in your default web browser.

Testing
To run the tests:
```
npm test
```

# Project Structure

## Backend:
Processes form submissions, verifies the child's information, and sends email notifications.
## Form Submission Process
When a child submits the form, the server performs the following checks:

## Child Registration Check:
Ensures the child is registered using data from userProfiles.json and users.json.
## Age Verification:
Confirms the child is less than 10 years old.
If the child is not registered or is older than 10 years, the web application displays an error page with a message explaining the issue. Otherwise, a confirmation page indicates that the request has been received.

## Email Notification
Every 15 seconds, the server sends an email with the details of all pending requests. The email includes:

Child's username (e.g., charlie.brown)
Child's address (e.g., 219-1130, Ikanikeisaiganaibaai, Musashino-shi, Tokyo)
Free text message as input in the form
Email Sender: do_not_reply@northpole.com
Recipient: santa@northpole.com

## Route Protections
The application includes route protections to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain pages or features.

## Extensive Use of Hooks
The frontend makes extensive use of React Hooks for managing state and side effects, ensuring a modern and maintainable codebase.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
Email: Nodemailer

## Additional Features and Points
- Protected Routes: Ensure that routes, such as error or success pages, cannot be accessed directly without proper authentication or validation.
- Resilient Frontend: The frontend should remain functional even if the server is down. Implement graceful error handling on the client side to manage server issues effectively.
- Cron Jobs: Cron jobs should be designed to continue running as scheduled, regardless of the webpageâ€™s state (e.g., even when the page is closed).
- Form Validation and Security: Validate forms to prevent security vulnerabilities, including XML injections, and ensure proper client-side and server-side validations are in place.
- Duplicate Message Prevention: Implement validation in the message field to prevent users from sending duplicate messages, reducing server load and enhancing performance.
- Message Deletion: Already sent messages are properly deleted from memory to conserve space.
- Backend for Frontend (BFF): The backend serves as a Backend for Frontend, providing the frontend with necessary APIs and facilitating efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

## Internationalization

- i18n Integration: Manages messages through i18n for easy updates and translation.
- Japanese Support: Includes Japanese translations for users in Japan.

## Asynchronous Message Queue
- An asynchronous message queue allows tasks to be processed independently and efficiently without blocking the main execution flow. In our application:

- Purpose: It ensures that tasks like sending emails and updating statuses are handled in the background, enhancing scalability and reliability.I use the async library to create queues that manage the sending of emails and updating user data. Each task is processed sequentially, ensuring that no task is missed and system resources are optimally used.
- Benefits: This approach prevents the application from becoming unresponsive during heavy loads, as tasks are queued and executed as resources become available.
